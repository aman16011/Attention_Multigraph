# Attention_Multigraph

It is a network embedding method for Multilayer graph which uses Graph attention layers along with Graph likelihood loss
to learn the node embeddings.

Attention parameter is guided in such a way that scores for Hset Node is as high as possible where as for Lset nodes is as low
 as possible.
 
In order to run the code :-
type "python train.py". It should be able to generate the embedding file with appropriate data file path.
